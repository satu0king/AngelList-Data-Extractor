# Angel.co Job List Data Extractor

AngelList is an excellent website to find amazing startup opportunities. However, due to a restriction on the website, it is difficult to filter jobs based on salary on the website. That is why I wrote a script to extract the jobs from AngelList. I have hardcoded the following filter parameters - `Software Engineer, Bangalore, 0-3 years experience`. Feel free to change the same.

## How to use?
Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `node main.js` to extract the data.
